    "track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic)\"\"\", \\\n",
    "\"\"\"Track Danceability (Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing\n",
    "based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat\n",
    "strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable)\"\"\", \\\n",

    "Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly vocal. The closer the instrumentalness\n",
    "value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content)\"\"\", \\\n",
    "\"\"\"Track Key (The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch\n",
    "Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = Câ™¯/Dâ™­, 2 = D, and so on)\"\"\", \\\n",
    "\"\"\"Track Liveness (Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.\n",
    "Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.)\"\"\", \\\n",

    "\"\"\"Track Speechiness (Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more\n",
    "exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0\n",
    "the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken\n",
    "words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech,\n",
    "either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely\n",
